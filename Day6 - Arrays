Definition:
An array in JavaScript is a data structure used to store multiple values in a single variable. 
It can hold elements of different data types (e.g., numbers, strings, objects).

Creation:
Arrays can be created using:

Square brackets []:

let arr = [1, 2, 3, "Hello", true];
The Array constructor:

let arr = new Array(5); // Creates an array of length 5
Accessing Elements:
Elements in an array are accessed using zero-based indexing:

console.log(arr[0]); // Accesses the first element

Common Properties:

length: Returns the number of elements in the array.
console.log(arr.length);
Common Methods:

Adding/Removing Elements:

push(): Adds elements to the end.
arr.push(4);
pop(): Removes the last element.
arr.pop();
unshift(): Adds elements to the beginning.
arr.unshift(0);
shift(): Removes the first element.
arr.shift();

Iterating:

for loop:
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) console.log(arr[i]);
forEach():
arr.forEach(element => console.log(element));

Manipulation:

splice(start, deleteCount, ...items): Removes or adds elements at specific indexes.
arr.splice(1, 2, "newElement");
slice(start, end): Creates a new array from a subset of elements.
let newArr = arr.slice(1, 3);

Searching:

indexOf(value): Returns the first index of the value.
console.log(arr.indexOf("Hello"));
includes(value): Checks if the array contains a value.
console.log(arr.includes(3));

Higher-Order Functions:

map(): Creates a new array by applying a function to each element.
let doubled = arr.map(x => x * 2);
filter(): Filters elements based on a condition.
let evens = arr.filter(x => x % 2 === 0);
reduce(): Reduces the array to a single value.
let sum = arr.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);

Special Features:

Arrays are objects in JavaScript and have additional methods and properties.
They can dynamically resize and do not require pre-defined sizes.
Example:

let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
fruits.push("Mango");
console.log(fruits); // ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Mango"]
console.log(fruits.length); // 4
