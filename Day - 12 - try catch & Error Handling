What is Error Handling?

Error handling refers to managing runtime errors to ensure the program can continue functioning or provide meaningful feedback.
In JavaScript, errors can occur due to various reasons like invalid inputs, server issues, or unexpected conditions.
Try-Catch Syntax

The try-catch block is used to handle exceptions in JavaScript.

try {
    // Code that may throw an error
} catch (error) {
    // Code to handle the error
}
How It Works
try Block:

Contains the code that may potentially throw an error.
If an error occurs, control is immediately passed to the catch block.
catch Block:

Handles the error.
The error parameter contains details about the error (e.g., message, name, stack trace).
Optional finally Block:

Executes regardless of whether an error occurred or not.
Useful for cleanup operations.
javascript
Copy code
finally {
    // Cleanup code
}
Example
javascript
Copy code
try {
    let result = 10 / 0; // No error, but let's assume logic error
    console.log(result);
    let obj = null;
    console.log(obj.name); // Throws an error
} catch (error) {
    console.error('An error occurred:', error.message);
} finally {
    console.log('Execution complete.');
}
Throwing Custom Errors
You can manually throw errors using the throw statement.
javascript
Copy code
function validateAge(age) {
    if (age < 18) {
        throw new Error('Age must be 18 or older.');
    }
    console.log('Age is valid.');
}

try {
    validateAge(16);
} catch (error) {
    console.error(error.message);
}
Types of Errors in JavaScript
SyntaxError: Mistakes in syntax (e.g., missing brackets).
ReferenceError: Accessing an undeclared variable.
TypeError: Incorrect data type operations.
RangeError: A number out of its range (e.g., invalid array length).
Custom Errors: Manually thrown errors.
Best Practices for Error Handling
Use Try-Catch Sparingly:

Focus on handling only exceptional cases, not regular control flow.
Graceful Degradation:

Provide fallbacks or user-friendly messages when errors occur.
Avoid Silent Failures:

Always log or inform the user about what went wrong.
Clean Up Resources:

Use the finally block for cleanup, such as closing file streams or clearing timers.
Custom Error Messages:

Create meaningful error messages to make debugging easier.
Validation Before Execution:

Validate inputs and conditions to prevent avoidable errors.
With proper error handling, JavaScript applications become more robust, maintainable, and user-friendly! ðŸ˜Š
